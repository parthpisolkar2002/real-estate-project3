Problem to Solve:

We aim to investigate the relationship between real estate values and household income in the tristate area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut). Specifically, we want to determine whether higher household incomes in certain ZIP codes correlate with higher real estate prices in those same areas. By analyzing and comparing these datasets, we seek to uncover patterns and insights that can inform our understanding of real estate market dynamics and economic conditions across different regions within the tristate area.

Data Cleanup and Analysis:

After selecting our datasets from Kaggle (USA Real Estate Dataset and US Household Income by ZIP Code), we explored and cleaned the data to include only the relevant information for the story we wanted to tell and the information we wanted to explore. We narrowed the USA real estate dataset to include only the tristate area and removed the column titled prev_sold_date. For the US Household Income data, we honed in exclusively on Household income, excluding categories such as Families, Married-Couple Families, and Nonfamily Households.
