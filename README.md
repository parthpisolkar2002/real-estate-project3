Data Cleanup and Analysis

After selecting our datasets from Kaggle (USA Real Estate Dataset and US Household Income by ZIP Code), we explored and cleaned the data to include only the relevant information for the story we wanted to tell and the information we wanted to explore. We narrowed the USA real estate dataset to include only the tristate area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) and removed the column titled prev_sold_date.
